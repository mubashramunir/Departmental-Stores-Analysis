# Departmental-Stores-Analysis
Considering the scale of the business and the CEO's preferences, we are using Excel to solve the queries. Ultimately, the decision should be based on factors such as the organization's resources, technical expertise, and long-term goals.
# Comparison of Weekly Data to Previous Year:
Using indices (current sales / previous sales * 100) is a common and effective way to compare weekly data to the previous year.
YTD (Year To Date) values can provide a broader perspective and help in understanding overall trends.
# Summary of Top Performing Stores and Departments:
Top 10 stores and departments can be determined based on sales volume or growth rate.
Similarly, the worst-performing stores and departments can be identified using the same criteria.
# Commission Calculation:
The commission for the top 5 performing stores can be calculated as 0.5% of their respective sales.
Year To Date (YTD) values for commissions can be calculated similarly to sales YTD.
# Dashboard Design Preferences:
Simple design with big numbers and clear visualizations.
Mobile-friendly layout.
Avoid clutter and dark themes to maintain readability and user-friendliness.
# Data Refresh and Recommendations:
Refreshing the dashboard with new data in the "New Week" folder should ideally be automated.
The time taken for data refresh depends on the volume of data and the complexity of calculations.
Invested in a data pipeline/warehouse to streamline data extraction and processing.
Considered implementing real-time data updates for more timely insights.
Provided resources for training and upskilling to maximize the potential of data tools and technologies.
