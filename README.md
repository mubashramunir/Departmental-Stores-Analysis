# Departmental-Stores-Analysis
As the Data Analyst for a Chain of Departmental stores. The CEO has asked to make a weekly sales dashboard/report. There is no data pipeline/warehouse available as such. Weekly data is extracted using a data tool connected to the POS at every store. The senior assistant has extracted a number of files to add to my report/dashboard. I will expected to update this dashboard and then send it to the CEO via a link or otherwise. 
Considering the scale of the business and the CEO's preferences, Power BI will be a more suitable choice due to its robust visualization capabilities and integration with various data sources. However, Streamlit could be a viable option for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Ultimately, the decision should be based on factors such as the organization's resources, technical expertise, and long-term goals.

# Comparison of Weekly Data to Previous Year:
Using indices (current sales / previous sales * 100) is a common and effective way to compare weekly data to the previous year.
YTD (Year To Date) values can provide a broader perspective and help in understanding overall trends.

# Summary of Top Performing Stores and Departments:
Top 10 stores and departments can be determined based on sales volume or growth rate.
Similarly, the worst-performing stores and departments can be identified using the same criteria.

# Commission Calculation:
The commission for the top 5 performing stores can be calculated as 0.5% of their respective sales.
Year To Date (YTD) values for commissions can be calculated similarly to sales YTD.

# Data Refresh and Recommendations:
The time taken for data refresh depends on the volume of data and the complexity of calculations.
Considered implementing real-time data updates for more timely insights.
Provided resources for training and upskilling to maximize the potential of data tools and technologies.
